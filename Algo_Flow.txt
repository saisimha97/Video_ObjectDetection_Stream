Here the task is to detect a human face from a webcam video stream and render it on a webpage

lets first check to render it onto a web page with any sort of detection (run SimpleWebStream.java)
1. Here we take snaps of videos using classes of OpenCV library
2. Using flask we render it on localhost by instantiating the  VideoCamera object and call the image snap function again and again (yield keyword)

Now after the first run is successful. The human face detection using tensorflow object detection API can be achieved by using pre-trained models 
on COCO dataset or training the primitive model and getting the desired Confusion Matrix

We are choosing Pre-trained model using Object Detection API:

We have a frozen model which ran over coco dataset from tensorflow object detection API which is used for our case which internally contains AlexNets(CNN)
as their classifiers

All the graph definition, Weights, and biases of the model are in serialized through google's ProtoBuf(Protocol Buffer)

After configuring the required and parameters we get back the parameters of boxes and percentage accuracy of detection
These boxes are finally appended

Finally, the image is rendered on the webpage
